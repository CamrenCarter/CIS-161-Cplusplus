3.4. Modify Delgados Tacos by displaying the menu of what the user can order, then the user can type in order what they would like to order using a else if structure. Then total the total price at the end of the program with the number of items ordered with and without tax. Beginner code for this project is attached above<br>

The manager of the Lake View Hotel wants a program that calculates and displays a guest's total bill. Each guest pays a room charge that is based on a per-night rate. For example, if the per-night rate is $100 and the guest stays two nights. the room charge is $200. Customers also may incur a one-time room service charge  of $35 dollars and a one-time telephone charge of $0.25 per minute. (Must be placed inside a while loop that asks you if you want to stay another night, you have to make a decision if you want to use the phone yes or no, and if you want room service yes or no.) Must have a total at the end. <br>
<br>
3.7. Create a program that asks the user if they have a right triangle, isosceles, or equilateral. You will be given 2 sides of the triangle. You must write a program that finds the length of the missing side. You must write a program the finds the perimeter, and area of the triangles.
<br>
The program must not end until you type the word STOP.
<br>
Example: Right triangle A side = 5, B side = 6, C side = ??<br>
Output: C side = 7.81<br>
Area of Right triangle = 15<br>
Perimeter of  Right triangle = 18.81<br>
Find the square root<br><br>
3.8. Create a program for ordering pizza, it must be created using a While loop or a Do While Loop. You must ask the user if they would like a pizza, what size, what toppings, and at the end you must total the price of the pizza with and without tax. Each size of pizza should be a different price and different toppings should be a different price. <br>
<br>
When repeating the program through the While Loop you should be ordering another pizza, at the end of the program it should total both pizza's with and without tax.
<br>
Example: Order one large pizza with pepperoni total cost is 15.99, the second pizza is a medium pizza total 12.99. Total price for both pizzas is 28.98 without tax.

3.9. Die rolling with random number generators. Make a game using random number generators that keeps a score.

3.10. What kinds of things would be difficult to program without loops?<br>
3.11. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the switch statement versus a series of if statements?<br>
3.12. When should you use a while loop over a do loop?<br>
3.13. Describe your favorite game in terms of the game loop. Is the game loop a good fit?<br>
